## Title
Enhancing Heatwave Predictability in Bangladesh through Deep Learning Approaches.
## Overview
A heatwave is an extended period of scorching weather, surpassing regional historical averages, and can severely impact infrastructure, energy costs, health, the economy, and ecology. In 2023, Bangladesh experienced some of its highest recorded temperatures. This study aims to evaluate various models to improve prediction accuracy and aid disaster preparedness and community resilience against extreme heat events in Bangladesh. The heat index, which combines humidity and air temperature to measure perceived heat, is closely related to heat waves. Both concepts assess the impact of high temperatures on human health, with higher Heat Index values indicating more extreme heatwave conditions and greater discomfort.

## Approach
Researched deep learning attention-based hybrid models to improve heatwave anticipation by obtaining a 96% accuracy rate and multi-step-ahead forecasting of temperature and humidity, enhancing heatwave anticipation

## DataSet:
The dataset used in this research is a private dataset which has been collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department(BMD). We have used the historical weather data of Bangladesh from 1996 to 2020. The data has been previously used in several studies related to weather.
